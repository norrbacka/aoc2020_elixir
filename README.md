# ðŸŽ„ Advent of Code 2020 - Elixir-edition ðŸŽ„

Hello there, and welcome to my solutions for Advent of Code 2020

This is one of those advent of codes journeys, and for me nearly a first experience in Elixir.

Enjoy, be safe, be healthy!

## How to run my code?
Well, something like this:

0. Install elixir (https://elixir-lang.org/install.html)
1. Browse to the root folder in a terminal, that is this folder where the readme is!
2. Run `iex -S mix`
3. Run `Aoc2020.DayX.taskY` where\
    X -> is the day you want to se the result for\
    Y -> is the task for that day you want to se the result for\
